# Final Fantasy XIV Duty Roulette
A simple WPF application to help me figure out what duty to do for my weekly Wondrous Tails.
The idea is that you select a duty category (Level 50 dungeons, for example) and it will randomly select a duty from the appropriate list.
There will also be a class/job roulette as well, but that will be implemented after the fact.
